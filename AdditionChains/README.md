## Addition chains

Simple brute-force programs to compute OEIS A003313 "Length of shortest addition chain for n"
and ...

    python shortest.py

brute-forces the shortest addition chain for n.

    python fastest.py

brute-forces the *fastest* program to compute multiplication-by-n in terms of addition,
in the fewest number of cycles, assuming that addition takes one cycle and that an
infinite number of additions can be dispatched simultaneously as long as all their
inputs are available from some previous cycle.
